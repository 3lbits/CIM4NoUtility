# Known Issues

Breaker was used instead of Fuse to ensure CGMES v2.4 conformity. CGMES v3.0 do support Fuse, but to highlight the difference between CGMES v3.0 and v2.4 they were left out in version 2.0. Feeder is not part of CGMES v3.0, but added to CIM17 and CDPSM. Upcoming version will include the Feeder and Fuse with the recommended way to model it.
