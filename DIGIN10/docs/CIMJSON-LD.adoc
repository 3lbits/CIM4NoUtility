:sectnums:

The following sections describe how conversion from CIMXML to CIMJSON-LD should be handled.

== Datatype
This section includes documentation of how to convert the following CIMXML datatypes to CIMJSON-LD:

. Primitives (Float, Boolean, Decimal, String, etc.)
. CIMDatatypes (ActivePower, RealEnergy, Resistance, etc.)
. Compounds (TimeInterval, DateInterval, etc.)
. Enumerators (Unit, Multiplier, etc.)

=== Primitives
The declaration of the primitives are covered by the JSON language and explained in https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/type.html[Type-specific keywords].

==== Decimal
In the cases where CIM defines decimals instead of float we are using string. Reason: As JSON does not support decimal and float is not precise enough, this is the best practice. 

=== CIMDatatypes
Multipliers and units are specified in the standard profile.

=== Enumerators
In CIMXML the url is used in enumerators, in JSON-LD we are just using the prefix.
*Example:* +
CIMXML: "http://iec.ch/TC57/CIM100#OperationalLimitDirectionKind.absoluteValue" + 
JSON-LD: "cim:OperationalLimitDirectionKind.absoluteValue" +

== Header and dataset

=== Convertion rule CIMXML -> CIMJSON-LD
This should be a lossless transformation where some data are duplicated:

|rdf:about	|Syntax	|@id	|

|md:Model.created	|Semantic	|prov:generatedAtTime	|Attribute will be removed when better provenance are available. Shall represent when the instance file is created. Need to declare as DateTime.

|md:Model.created	|Semantic	|dcterms:issued	|Represent when the dataset (graph) is created. Need to declare as Date.

|md:Model.scenarioTime	|Semantic	|dcterms:temporal	|Need to declare as dcterms:PeriodOfTime and xsd:dateTime. For EQ, DY, GL, this would be an open interval.

|md:Model.scenarioTime	|Semantic	|dcterms:temporalResolution	|Need to declare as Duration. Apply to SSH, TP and SV to state that the dataset include hourly values, "PT1H".

|md:Model.description	|Semantic	|dcterms:description	|Shall support multiple language.

|md:Model.modelingAuthoritySet	|Semantic	|dcat:isVersionOf	|Represent the abstract dataset.

|md:Model.profile	|Semantic	|dcterms:conformsTo	|Needs to be declared as multiple.

|md:Model.version	|Syntax	|dcat:version	|It relates to the version of the document and not the version of the mode/dataset. Needs to follow prov:generatedAtTime.

|md:Model.DependentOn	|Semantic	|dcterms:references	|Needs to be declared as multiple. Should include the title for human readable.
