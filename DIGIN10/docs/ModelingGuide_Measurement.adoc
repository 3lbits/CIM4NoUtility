== Measurement 
[red]#Describe how to use measurement#

The specialised classes Analog and AnalogValue are used to model measurements and measurement values. Currently all values are represented in MW and MVAr.

Analog (Measurement) should reference the relevant PowerSystemResource(PSR), Terminal and Asset. +
Asset should reference the relevant AssetInfo and PSR. + 
PSR should also reference AssetInfo when relevant +
AnalogValue should reference the relevant measurement and value sources. +
Remote sources should reference the relevant remote unit. +
Communication links should also reference relevant remote units.




[red]#Scenarios for measurements of the following components are included in the DIGIN10 model:#
 
 * CurrentTransformer (CT)
 * VoltageTransformer (VT)
 * PotentialTransformer (ref issue 158/159)
 * Switching (ref issue 158/159)
 * PowerTransformer 
 ** PowerTransformerEnd
 * Consumption (ref issue 158/159)

=== Modeling examples
See modeling examples in the figures below:

When measuring per phase there should be 1 CurrentTransformer(PSR) per phase and 1 Asset per phase.
