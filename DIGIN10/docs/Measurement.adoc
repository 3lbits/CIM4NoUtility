NOTE: ref issue 50. _In progress_


*Issue:* Include measurements in the data transfer in ConformLoad.

*Goal:* Use created example as guideline for how to implement measurements in data transfer.

*Background:* Want to enable PF calculations based on real time data. The inclusion of measurements will also allow better estimation of future scenarios. (Steady state value is also based on the real time series.)

*Discussion:* Currently MeterReading is used as basis in example. MeterReading is not linked to EndDevice directly. GetMeterReading seems to be the more reasonable option as it is has association to EndDevice.


*Actions:* _In example_

. cim:IdentifiedObject.name and cim:IdentifiedObject.aliasName defined in ReadingType rather than Reading.

. To do: 

.. Look into GetMeterReading and EndDevice control 

.. Remove EndDeviceEventDetail from example

.. Does every Reading need their own unique identifier?
