# Known Issues

Breaker was used instead of Fuse to ensure CGMES v2.4 conformity. CGMES v3.0 do support Fuse, but for highlighting the difference between CGMES v3.0 and v2.4 they were left in version 2.0. Feeder is not part of CGMES v3.0, but added to CIM17 and CDPSM. Upcoming version will include the Feeder and Fuse with the recommend way to model it.
