# Welcome to the ElBits Utillity Standardization Community Platform
The goal of ElBits Data Standardization is to establish a best practice for the use of data exchange formats within the Norwegian (and international) electrical utility industry. To acheive this the whole electric utility industry must contribute. 
The Community platform shall serve as an arena for development of best practices and competence enhancement within the Norwegian electric utility industry.

## :seedling: Get involved
All communication within the Community platform shall be in English to promote interoperability and international collaboration.

### Code development
In order to ensure a good working environment for the Community platform all contributors must be  aligned on a GitHub workflow, therefore, all contributors shall follow the GitHub repo strategy: [RepositoryStrategy.md](RepositoryStrategy.md)

### Issues
Issues are used to plan, discuss and track tasks related to use cases that Elbits_Utility_Standardization is working on.<br>
Issues are also used to report bugs.
